            "### PROLOGUE: THE DYING BLADE\n\nThe Stormblade weighed heavy in Eldrin’s grip, its once-brilliant glow now reduced to faint pulses of light, like the last breaths of a dying man. He stood amidst the ruins of Vaeloria’s grand hall, the marble floors cracked and stained with the blood of those who had fallen defending it. The Battle of Black Sands had been a massacre, not a retreat. The air still smelled of charred flesh and molten steel, a grim reminder of how quickly Malagarath’s forces had overrun them. Lyria knelt beside him, her silver eyes reflecting the blade’s dim light as she pressed a cloth soaked in moonbloom extract against the wound beneath his armor. 'The shadow-rot spreads,' she murmured, her voice tight. 'It moves faster than before. If we don’t reach the Shard soon—' Eldrin cut her off with a sharp gesture. 'We’ll find it.' His words carried more conviction than he felt. The Shard of Skies was their last hope—a relic said to reignite the Stormblade’s power. But no one had seen it in centuries, not since the Sundering tore the kingdom apart. The sound of hurried footsteps echoed through the hall as Kael Sunstrider, his griffon’s wings tattered from battle, dragged a hooded figure into the light. 'Found this one skulking in the ruins,' Kael said, shoving the stranger forward. The figure lowered her hood, revealing milky white eyes that shimmered like mist. 'The Veil of Tears remembers you, Stormborn,' she whispered. 'And it hungers for what you’ve forgotten.' Behind her, the shadows seemed to coil like living things, reaching toward Eldrin’s boots."

            "### CHAPTER I: THE WEAVER’S BARGAIN\n\nThe stranger called herself The Weaver. She moved like smoke, her tattered gray robes whispering against the broken tiles. Up close, her milky eyes held swirling patterns that made Eldrin’s stomach twist—like staring into a storm cloud. 'I’ve walked the Wraithbone Pass twice,' she said, tracing a map into the dust with a finger too long to be human. 'The Shard lies beyond the Veil of Tears, but the path is not one of distance. It is a journey of memory.' Lyria’s grip on Eldrin’s arm tightened. 'What do you mean?' The Weaver’s lips curled. 'The Veil is alive. To cross it, you must feed it a memory. One that burns.' Kael scoffed, his hand resting on his sword. 'And why should we trust you? You stink of the Wraithkin.' The Weaver laughed, a sound like dry leaves scraping stone. 'Because I am the only one who knows what Malagarath truly seeks in the Shard. And it is not what you think.' That night, as the others slept fitfully amidst the ruins, Eldrin sat sharpening his blade under the cold light of the moon. Lyria found him there, her footsteps silent on the ash. 'You can’t trust her,' she said, her voice low. 'The Veil doesn’t just take memories—it twists them. I’ve seen it in my visions.' Eldrin’s hands stilled. 'What choice do we have? The Stormblade weakens by the hour.' He lifted the weapon, its edge dull despite his efforts. Lyria hesitated, then showed him her marked palm—the rune pulsed faintly. 'There’s another way. But it requires blood. Mine.' Outside, unseen by either, The Weaver watched them from the shadows, humming a tune that made the wind itself still in dread."

            "### CHAPTER II: THE WHISPERING PASS\n\nThe Wraithbone Pass was a graveyard of stone and memory. The canyon walls were fused with the skeletal remains of warriors who had died in the Sundering, their petrified faces locked in eternal screams. Some clutched weapons; others reached toward the sky as if begging for mercy. The Weaver led the way, her bare feet making no sound against the bone-strewn path. 'Don’t look directly at them,' she warned. 'And never speak your true name here. The dead are always listening.' Lyria clutched her temples as whispers slithered into her mind—voices speaking in tongues older than Vaeloria. They peeled back layers of her thoughts, probing for weaknesses. Eldrin’s Stormblade flickered weakly, its light pushing back the shadows just enough to reveal figures moving within the stone. Not reflections—something else. Kael nocked an arrow, his griffon’s feathers bristling. 'Something’s following us.' A rasping breath echoed from behind. Then another. Eldrin turned slowly. Three figures lurked in their wake—Wraithkin, their bodies stitched together from bone and shadow. One had too many arms; another’s jaw hung by sinewy threads. The largest cocked its head, its hollow eye sockets fixed on Lyria’s marked hand. 'Run!' The Weaver hissed. The group sprinted through the narrowing pass, the Wraithkin’s laughter licking at their heels. Kael fired an arrow—it passed clean through the lead creature’s chest, striking sparks against the stone behind it. Just as skeletal fingers brushed Eldrin’s cloak, The Weaver yanked him into a crevice barely wider than his shoulders. The others tumbled after her—into darkness so complete it felt alive. The last thing Eldrin saw before the light vanished was Lyria’s rune flaring like a struck match."

            "### CHAPTER III: THE VEIL’S REFLECTIONS\n\nLyria summoned a witchlight, its pale glow revealing a cavern of mirrored obsidian. The walls, floor, and ceiling were all polished black glass, reflecting their group infinitely in every direction. But these reflections weren’t passive—they moved independently, showing versions of themselves that were older, younger, or altogether unrecognizable. One reflection showed Eldrin with Malagarath’s crown upon his brow; another showed Lyria with empty eye sockets, weeping black tears. 'The Veil shows what was and what may yet be,' The Weaver said, her voice echoing strangely. 'Choose your path wisely.' Kael reached out to touch a mirror—his reflection grabbed his wrist, yanking him forward with unnatural strength. Lyria’s magic severed the connection just in time. 'Don’t interact with them!' she warned. One reflection caught Eldrin’s eye: himself kneeling before Malagarath, the Stormblade offered hilt-first. The image shifted—Malagarath seated on Vaeloria’s throne, the Stormblade broken in his grip. 'Illusions,' Kael snapped, though his voice wavered. But Lyria was trembling. 'No. Possibilities.' The Weaver stepped toward the third mirror. 'This is the one that frightens you most. Why?' Eldrin said nothing. The truth festered in his chest alongside the shadow-rot: Malagarath was no invader. He was Vaeloria’s first king—Eldrin’s ancestor. And the Stormblade had once been his, before it was cursed. A guttural roar shook the cavern. The mirrors shattered into thousands of jagged pieces. Beyond the falling glass, the Wraithkin emerged, their bodies now fused into a single monstrous shape—a towering abomination with six arms and a mouth that split its torso vertically. 'You led them here,' Lyria accused The Weaver. The old woman grinned, her teeth elongating. 'No. You did. The Veil thrives on secrets—and yours is ripe for the taking.'"

            "### CHAPTER IV: THE SHARD’S PRICE\n\nThe group fled deeper into the cavern, the fused Wraithkin’s claws scraping against stone as it gave chase. The tunnel walls pulsed like living flesh, contracting as if trying to crush them. Lyria’s witchlight revealed grotesque murals carved into the stone—images of ancient kings offering sacrifices to a faceless god. The tunnel opened abruptly into a vast chamber where the Shard of Skies hovered above an altar of black basalt. The crystal was smaller than Eldrin expected—no larger than his fist—but its blue light painted the entire cavern in eerie hues. 'At last,' he breathed, stepping forward. But Lyria seized his arm. 'Wait. Look.' The altar was carved with runes: *‘Only the unworthy may wield me.’* The Weaver chuckled. 'The Shard tests all who seek it. Are you prepared to fail, Stormborn?' Kael fired an arrow at the approaching Wraithkin, but the creature barely flinched—the projectile lodged in its ribcage, doing no visible damage. Eldrin raised the Stormblade, but its light guttered out entirely, leaving them in near-darkness. The Wraithkin lunged. Lyria’s magic flared, silver tendrils wrapping around the creature’s limbs, searing its shadow-flesh. The Weaver clapped her hands—a sound like thunder—and the Wraithkin froze mid-step. 'The Veil has had its fill of fear,' she said. 'Now, Stormborn. Touch the Shard and face your truth.' Eldrin reached out. The crystal’s glow intensified, casting his shadow against the wall—except the shadow turned its head independently, smiling with Malagarath’s face. Lyria screamed a warning, but Eldrin’s fingers closed around the Shard anyway. Agony ripped through him. The world dissolved into fractured visions: A throne of bones. A storm of screaming faces. Lyria kneeling before an altar, her marked hand raised in sacrifice. The Shard’s voice slithered into his mind: *‘Show me the day you failed. Show me why you deserve this power.’*"

            "### CHAPTER V: THE ECLIPSE’S SHADOW\n\nEldrin awoke on the cavern floor, his mouth filled with the taste of copper. The Shard lay beside him, its light now dimmed to a faint pulse. Lyria crouched over him, her nose bleeding freely, her marked hand pressed to his chest. 'It’s done,' she said hoarsely. The Wraithkin and The Weaver were gone—only Kael remained, his arrow still trained on the darkness, his griffon’s wings mantled defensively. 'What did you see?' he demanded. Eldrin’s voice was raw, as if he’d been screaming. 'The truth. Malagarath isn’t just my ancestor. He’s the Stormblade’s first master. It answers to him.' Lyria’s marked hand twitched, the rune shifting under her skin like a living thing. 'Then why hasn’t he reclaimed it?' Eldrin met her gaze, his eyes haunted. 'Because it’s cursed. The blade steals the life of its wielder to fuel its power. He wants me to bear that cost—to die weakening myself so he can take it back at full strength.' Kael cursed, kicking a loose stone. 'The eclipse is hours away. What now?' Outside the cavern, the sky had darkened to the color of a fresh bruise. The Shard had shown Eldrin one more thing: Malagarath’s weakness. Not a weapon, not a spell—a name. The Forgotten God’s name, etched into Lyria’s palm. She followed his gaze, her silver eyes widening. 'No,' she whispered. 'You can’t mean to—' Eldrin stood, gripping the Stormblade. Its weight felt different now—not just a weapon, but a burden. 'We return to the Ashen Keep. It’s time to finish this.' As they exited the cavern, the Shard’s voice followed them, whispering: *‘You will kneel before him, Stormborn. As you did at Black Sands.’*"

            "### CHAPTER VI: THE KEEP’S SECRET\n\nThe Ashen Keep was silent when they returned—no sentries on the walls, no fires in the braziers. Only the wind whistling through the ruins like a mourner’s lament. 'Where is everyone?' Kael muttered, his griffon’s claws scraping nervously against the cobblestones. Lyria’s vision struck without warning—her knees buckled as she gasped, her eyes flooding with black. 'They’re here. In the walls.' Eldrin pressed a hand to the nearest stone. It was warm. Pulsing. The Keep’s foundations were threaded with veins of Wraithbone, and something was stirring within them—a presence that made the Stormblade vibrate in warning. 'Malagarath’s work,' he realized. 'He’s turned the Keep into a beacon for the eclipse. When the moon aligns...' Kael drew his sword, his face grim. 'Then we collapse it before that happens.' Lyria gripped Eldrin’s wrist, her fingers icy. 'The Shard showed you something else. What?' He hesitated. The vision had revealed a hidden chamber beneath the Keep—a prison for the Forgotten God, its seals tied to Lyria’s bloodline. To free it would grant power enough to challenge Malagarath. But the cost... The stones trembled. Shadows pooled in the courtyard, coalescing into familiar shapes: Bloodsworn warriors, their armor etched with eclipse sigils. At their center stood The Weaver, her milky eyes now full of swirling stars. 'The Veil has chosen,' she intoned, her voice layered with echoes. 'The Stormborn will face his king.' Behind her, the Keep’s great doors groaned open, revealing a throne of fused bones—and upon it, a figure wreathed in living shadow. Eldrin raised the Stormblade, its edge catching the first sickly light of the rising eclipse. The time for secrets was over. The time for choices had come."

            "### CHAPTER VII: THE FORGOTTEN GOD’S WHISPER\n\nThe throne room was colder than Eldrin remembered. The stained-glass windows, once depicting Vaeloria’s founding, now showed twisted parodies—kings kneeling before a faceless deity, their crowns melting into liquid shadow. The figure on the bone throne stirred, its form shifting like smoke. 'Eldrin Stormborn,' it spoke, and the voice was Malagarath’s, yet not—deeper, older, layered with the screams of the Sundering. Lyria’s mark blazed so brightly it cast their shadows thirty feet tall. The Weaver stepped forward, her body elongating unnaturally. 'The pact is nearly complete,' she crooned. 'The god wakes.' Kael loosed an arrow—it disintegrated midair. Eldrin gripped the Stormblade, but its light was erratic, pulsing in time with Lyria’s rune. 'What pact?' he demanded. Malagarath rose, his armor dissolving into tendrils of darkness. 'The one your ancestors made. The Stormblade was never a weapon—it was a lock. And you’ve brought the key.' His void-like gaze fixed on Lyria. She staggered, clutching her marked hand as the rune burned through her glove. The floor trembled. Cracks spiderwebbed across the stones, revealing glimpses of something vast moving beneath the Keep. 'The Forgotten God...' Lyria gasped. 'It’s not imprisoned. It’s feeding.' The Weaver’s laughter echoed as the first eclipse-light touched the throne. Choices crystallized: Fight Malagarath directly? Free the god and risk annihilation? Or—Eldrin’s eyes met Lyria’s—shatter the Stormblade and end the bloodline’s curse forever?"

            "### CHAPTER VIII: THE STORMBLADE’S FINAL LIGHT\n\nChaos erupted. The Bloodsworn charged as the floor buckled, their eclipse-sigils flaring red. Kael’s griffon screeched, tearing into the nearest warrior with talons and beak. Lyria fell to her knees, her marked hand searing black lines into her flesh—the rune was unraveling, its power bleeding into the cracks beneath them. Eldrin raised the Stormblade, but its light guttered like a dying candle. Malagarath advanced, his form now indistinct—a living shadow with too many arms. 'You see now, don’t you?' he hissed. 'The blade was never yours. Just as the throne was never mine. We are all pawns for the hunger below.' The Weaver circled them, her body splitting at the seams—revealing glimpses of something winged and many-eyed beneath her skin. Lyria screamed as the rune’s power surged through her, her back arching unnaturally. 'It’s in my mind—!' she choked. The visions came to Eldrin then, unbidden: The Forgotten God was no benevolent deity. It was the source of the shadow-rot, the true architect of the Sundering. And Lyria’s bloodline had been its jailers. Now the eclipse was its key. The Stormblade shuddered in Eldrin’s grip, its cracks spreading. One final choice remained: He could plunge it into Lyria’s mark, sealing the god away—but killing her in the process. Or he could break it over the throne, ending the curse but unleashing whatever lay beneath. As the eclipse reached totality, the Keep’s walls began to bleed black ichor. Malagarath’s laughter shook the stones. And Lyria, her eyes now fully black, whispered a single word—the god’s true name."
