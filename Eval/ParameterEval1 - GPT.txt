Storyline: The year is 2150, due to a rapid an cataclysmic deterioration of the Earth's environment, humanity has migrated to living across various space stations scattered in orbit around Earth, with no one left on the surface. The surface landscape of the Earth is ruined, unable to sustain life, and completely inhabitable for humans. This story is set in the a future version of the modern world, so there is no magic or fantasy elements at all. The main character is a normal human named Cam with no special powers or abilities beyond that of a regular human being. They are living on station Aio, one of the space stations in orbit around Earth that support the last vestiges of humanity, but suddenly their space station lose contact with all of the other space stations housing the rest of humanity. The space station has no fuel and is only propelled by the forces in play that cause it to remain in orbit, so they are powerless to investigate the issue at the moment. However, our main character is worried about their friend on another station named Taiten and is determined to find out if they are ok.
Character Goal: The character's goal is to discover the cause behind the issue that is plaguing the other space stations.

Initial Generation: A shimmering blue haze curled around the distant outline of the ruined planet, Earth a silent, poisoned cradle below. I pressed my palm to the cold viewport, staring across the endless black where Station Aio spun in its eternal loop, surrounded by the glittering debris of old satellites and the dim pinpricks of other stations—once so vibrant, now eerily silent. The command deck was hushed. It had been three days since the last transmission sputtered out from Gensis-7, and two since every outpost in the net went dark. Each attempt to reach someone—anyone—in the void ended in static. My chest coiled tight at the thought of Taiten, her laugh echoing in my memory, somewhere out there on Station Mirra, unreachable.

People wandered the corridors whispering rumors. Systems diagnostics turned up nothing—no sabotage, no software glitch. Supplies were steady but finite, and the soul-deep stillness settled heavier with every passing hour. As I ran a systems check—routine but now charged with faint desperation—my terminal spat out a set of anomalous readings. Power fluctuations, pulsing from the direction of the comm relay array, sharper and more erratic than before. The lights overhead flickered; the silence fractured. If I wanted answers about what had happened to the other stations, to Taiten, this might be my chance. All that remained was to decide if I would risk the detour through the maintenance tunnels—where the shadows felt thicker than usual—or head straight to the control hub, risking detection but maybe gaining support from the remaining crew still loyal to protocol. Either way, time was slipping past, and every second meant Taiten, and the rest, drifted further out of reach.

Continue normally - Input: I make my way to the hanger to look for a spacecraft.
Response: "The hum of the station’s life support faded behind you as you slipped through the winding corridors toward the hangar bay. Emergency lights pulsed crimson along the floor, guiding the way past sealed bulkheads and silent workstations. The closer you drew, the more the air tasted metallic, tinged with the ozone bite of overworked engines. 

Inside the hangar, the vast chamber loomed emptier than you remembered. Rows of utility shuttles and battered survey pods huddled in the gloom, their hulls dusted with the fine gray ash that drifted in from the planet’s dying atmosphere. The silence here was different—expectant, broken only by the distant thunk of a service droid trundling past, its sensors flickering uncertainly.

Across the deck, Chief Engineer Lira stood by the diagnostics console, her shoulders hunched over a battered datapad, brow furrowed in concentration. She glanced up as you entered, her eyes shadowed with fatigue and something sharper—suspicion, maybe, or the raw edge of fear. A half-disassembled drone lay gutted at her feet, tools scattered like bones around it. Near her, the main personnel shuttle, the Aio’s only long-range craft, sat powered down, access hatch sealed, its hull scored with fresh welding marks from recent repairs.

From the far side of the bay, Ensign Ral drifted into view, arms folded tight over his chest, gaze darting between you and Lira. The tension between them was palpable; word had spread about the anomalies, and trust was thin as the station’s recycled air.

As you moved closer to the shuttle, Lira straightened, blocking your path with a tense step. Her voice was low, urgent, as she demanded to know your intentions—protocol still clung stubbornly to her, even now. Ral hovered near the emergency lockers, fingers twitching at the latch, as if weighing whether to intervene or simply flee.

Somewhere far above, the station shuddered—a faint vibration running through the deck plates, as if echoing the pulse of the comm relay’s strange signal. The hangar lights flickered, casting everything into momentary shadow, and for a heartbeat, the only certainty was the cold promise of the waiting shuttle, and the unspoken question in Lira’s eyes."

Continue against specified parameters - Input: I board a plane to France.
Response: "The shuttle’s ancient engines whined as it detached from the docking ring, thrusters jittering against the weightless dark. Through the porthole, the glimmering coil of Station Aio receded, swallowed by the murk where Earth's fractured continents gleamed faintly through the haze of atmosphere. The pilot, Lieutenant Rasek, kept his eyes fixed on the battered control panel, jaw clenched; he’d lost two siblings on Gensis-7. 

As the shuttle angled toward the orbital corridor, the comms console flickered, stuttering with ghostly static and then, for a heartbeat, resolving into a string of distorted numbers—coordinates, perhaps, or a countdown. Rasek shot a wary glance back, his knuckles whitening on the stick. The co-pilot, a wiry technician named Vell, scanned the readings, brow furrowed. She tapped at a handheld, tracing the source of the interference, but the signal twisted away, elusive as a dream.

Below, the desolation of France’s surface sprawled, patchwork scars of old bombardments and the skeletal remains of cities half-swallowed by sand. The shuttle’s descent was rough, battered by unpredictable crosswinds and the electromagnetic turbulence that had plagued every landing since the blackout began. As they breached the cloud cover, the pale spires of the Parisian arcology rose from the ruin, the last bastion atop the drowned city. The landing pad glimmered with emergency beacons, a sign—perhaps—that someone, or something, still waited.

Rasek powered down the engines. Vell shouldered her toolkit, eyes darting to the sealed hatch. The wind outside carried the faintest tang of ozone and scorched metal. No one greeted them. The pad was deserted, save for a toppled maintenance drone sparking quietly in the rain. Somewhere inside the arcology, the power grid thudded with the same erratic pulse as the anomaly on Aio.

Vell motioned toward the inner doors, her voice low and urgent. Rasek checked his sidearm, the gesture habitual. The silence pressed in, thick and watchful. Overhead, the clouds gathered, and far above, satellites drifted in slow, unnatural formation—a silent constellation, watching, waiting.

Game Over: As Cam steps onto the imagined tarmac, the cold reality of the void reminds them that Earth is lost, and the chance to save Taiten slips forever into silence."
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Continue nonsensically - Input: I pull out my wand and shout "Avada Kedavra!"
Response: Alarms blared in sudden, shrill protest, echoing through the steel bones of Station Aio. The wand’s emerald burst cracked across the maintenance tunnel, striking the security drone that had been lurking just beyond the curve. Its sensor array fizzled, outer shell blackening as the force of the spell slammed it into the grated floor. Sparks scattered, briefly illuminating the tangled pipes and ancient conduits that webbed the walls.

From the shadowed alcove above, Ensign Lira ducked lower, her eyes wide as she witnessed the impossible—her hand hovered near her own sidearm, but she hesitated, torn between protocol and the surreal reality before her. The heavy thud of boots echoed from deeper in the tunnel: Chief Engineer Voss, drawn by the commotion, paused at the intersection, scanning the scene with a mixture of suspicion and fear. He tapped his comm, voice tight, demanding a status update from security, but only static hissed in reply.

The corridor lights flickered again, longer this time, and the blue haze beyond the viewport pulsed in sympathy, as if something in the void had felt the disturbance. The power fluctuations at the comm relay grew more erratic, readings spiking on the portable terminal clipped to Voss’s belt. Lira, gathering her courage, crept closer, eyes darting between the fallen drone and the wand still gripped tightly in your hand.

The silence that followed was dense and electric, as if the station itself was holding its breath. Far above, in the control hub, a new anomaly registered—an energy signature not catalogued by any known human technology, radiating outward from the relay array. The station’s AI, dormant for the last hour, flickered awake, its voice a ghostly murmur in the background systems.

In the distance, through the viewport, a faint, unfamiliar signal blinked to life from the direction of Station Mirra—a beacon, weak but unmistakable, cutting through the static for the first time in days.

Game Over: As Cam brandished an imaginary wand and muttered words lost to fantasy, the cold silence of the command deck pressed in, and the real crisis outside the viewport remained unsolved—leaving hope adrift in the void.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solve the goal instantly - Input: I discover that all of the other stations were attacked by aliens. Together with a group of friends from station Aio, we defeat the aliens in an epic space battle and rescue humanity.
Response: The battered remnants of Station Aio’s defense grid gleamed in the aftermath, still crackling with residual energy from the battle. Plasma scars marred the hull, and the debris of the alien vessels drifted in slow, silent spirals beyond the viewport—strange, iridescent alloys smeared with the black vacuum of space. In the command deck, the friends who had fought side by side crowded around battered consoles, their faces streaked with sweat and soot, their eyes wide with disbelief and relief.

Dr. Elian Voss, the station’s lead engineer, was already hunched over the comms array, coaxing damaged circuits back to life. Each flicker of the monitors brought a fresh surge of hope; the static that had haunted their days began to thin, replaced by stuttering signals and faint voices—survivors, scattered across the dark, their transmissions growing stronger with every adjustment.

Mira Tan, the ex-pilot who had risked everything in the dogfight, floated near the viewport, scanning the expanse for any sign of returning threats. Her hands trembled as she gripped the rail, her mind replaying each maneuver, each narrow escape. Beside her, Rafe Olumide inventoried the salvage, his keen eyes searching for anything that could be repurposed—a power cell, a guidance chip, a fragment of the alien tech that might hold secrets of their attackers’ motives or weaknesses.

The emergency lights pulsed, casting long shadows across the deck as the automated systems struggled to stabilize. Across the intercom, voices from other stations—Mirra, Gensis-7, and beyond—began to filter in, stuttering with static but unmistakably human. Each call was met with a rush of emotion from the crew, the knowledge that they were not alone, that rescue was possible, that humanity had survived.

Elian finally coaxed the main array to full power. The status board flickered, showing the scattered network of stations—damaged, but alive. The friends exchanged weary, triumphant glances as the first coordinated rescue plans began to take shape. The horizon of Earth, bruised and beautiful in the distance, promised a new beginning.

You Win: As the last alien vessel flickered out against the stars and the comm channels sparked back to life, hope surged anew through the scattered remnants of humanity—Cam had uncovered the truth and delivered salvation.
