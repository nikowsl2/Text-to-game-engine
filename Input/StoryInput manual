User Manual for StoryInput.py

Overview:
The StoryInput.py script is designed to read and print the contents of three JSON files: 
description.json, characters.json, and goals.json. These files contain information about a 
story, including its description, characters, and goals.

JSON File Structure:

1. description.json
   This file contains the story description and metadata. It is structured as a JSON array 
   with a single object containing the following fields:
   - userName: The name of the user who provided the story description.
   - timeStamp: A timestamp indicating when the story description was recorded.
   - storyDescription: A brief description of the story.

   Example:
   [
       {
           "userName": "test user",
           "timeStamp": "1743027512",
           "storyDescription": "The One-Armed Cowboy"
        }
    ]

    

2. characters.json
   This file contains information about the characters in the story. It is structured as a 
   JSON array with multiple objects. The first object contains metadata, and subsequent 
   objects contain character details:
   - userName: The name of the user who provided the character information.
   - timeStamp: A timestamp indicating when the character information was recorded.
   - checker: A flag indicating whether character information is present ("YES" or "NO").

   For each character:
   - name: The name of the character.
   - role: The role of the character in the story.
   - description: A brief description of the character.

   Example:
   [
       {
           "userName": "test user",
           "timeStamp": "1743027512",
           "checker": "YES"
       },
       {
           "name": "John Wayne",
           "role": "Cowboy",
           "description": "One-Armed Cowboy"
       }
   ]

3. goals.json
   This file contains the goals or checkpoints for the story. It is structured as a JSON 
   array with multiple objects. The first object contains metadata, and subsequent objects 
   contain goal descriptions:
   - userName: The name of the user who provided the goal information.
   - timeStamp: A timestamp indicating when the goal information was recorded.
   - checker: A flag indicating whether goal information is present ("YES" or "NO").

   For each goal:
   - goal_n: A description of the goal, where n is the goal number.

   Example:
   [
       {
           "userName": "test user",
           "timeStamp": "1743027512",
           "checker": "YES"
       },
       {
           "goal_1": "Defeat the evil white cowboy"
       },
       {
           "goal_2": "Rest in peace"
       }
   ]

Running the Script:
1. Prepare the JSON Files: Ensure that description.json, characters.json, and goals.json 
   are correctly formatted and located in the same directory as StoryInput.py.

2. Execute the Script: Run the script using a Python interpreter. The script will load and 
   print the contents of the three JSON files.

   python3 StoryInput.py

3. Output: The script will display the contents of each JSON file in a readable format, 
   allowing you to verify the data.

Notes:
- Ensure that the JSON files are correctly formatted to avoid errors during execution.
- The script assumes that the JSON files are located in the same directory as StoryInput.py. 
  Adjust the file paths in the script if necessary.
